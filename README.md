# Slide Detector

Usually instructors only upload their lecture videos online but possibly not their original PPT files, and this application helps to transform lecture videos into PPT slides. Hope you would like it!

Also if you are not familiar with code execution, [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10TZ7bD07nOKC8GSoc_x7Di2dTThquMer?usp=sharing) here provides a .dmg file for MacOS users.

# Usage
```
pip install requirements.txt
python app.py
```
Then you should be able to launch the app.
